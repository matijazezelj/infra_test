Security hardening for OpenSearch logging stack

Comprehensive security improvements across infrastructure and application layers.

Infrastructure (terraform/main.tf):
- Enable Azure Network Policies for pod-to-pod traffic control
- Enable Azure Policy for Kubernetes compliance
- Add Log Analytics workspace for audit logging
- Disable public IPs on nodes

Secrets Management:
- Remove all hardcoded passwords from config files
- Use Kubernetes Secrets with secretKeyRef
- Update .gitignore to prevent secret file commits
- Add instructions for manual secret creation

Pod Security:
- Add securityContext to run as non-root (UID 1000)
- Enable readOnlyRootFilesystem
- Drop all capabilities
- Set allowPrivilegeEscalation to false

Application Security:
- Change Dashboards from LoadBalancer to ClusterIP
- Enable TLS certificate verification in Vector
- Add secure cookie settings for Dashboards
- Disable API playground in production

Documentation:
- Complete README rewrite with security documentation
- Add deployment order with secrets step
- Add troubleshooting guide
